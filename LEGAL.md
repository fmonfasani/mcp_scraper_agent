# ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Guidelines for Web Scraping

**IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE: Please read this document carefully before using the Scraping MCP Agent.**

## üö® Disclaimer

**This software is provided for educational and legitimate business purposes only.** The developers and contributors of this project are not responsible for any misuse, legal violations, or damages that may result from using this software. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their use complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and website terms of service.

## üìã Legal Framework

### üåç **Jurisdictional Considerations**

Web scraping legality varies significantly by jurisdiction. Laws that may apply include:

- **United States**: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
- **European Union**: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Copyright Directive
- **United Kingdom**: Computer Misuse Act, Data Protection Act
- **Canada**: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
- **Australia**: Privacy Act, Copyright Act

**‚ö†Ô∏è Always consult with legal counsel familiar with your jurisdiction before scraping.**

### üèõÔ∏è **Key Legal Principles**

#### **1. Publicly Available Data**
- Generally, scraping publicly available data is more legally defensible
- However, "publicly available" doesn't mean "free to use for any purpose"
- Consider the context and purpose of data collection

#### **2. Terms of Service (ToS)**
- Website Terms of Service are legally binding contracts
- Violation of ToS can lead to legal action
- Some courts have ruled that ToS violations alone don't constitute federal crimes
- **Best Practice**: Always review and respect website ToS

#### **3. robots.txt**
- Industry standard for communicating crawling preferences
- Not legally binding but shows good faith effort
- Courts may consider robots.txt compliance in legal proceedings
- **Best Practice**: Always check and respect robots.txt directives

#### **4. Rate Limiting and Server Impact**
- Overwhelming servers with requests can be considered abuse
- May violate computer crime laws in some jurisdictions
- Can cause actual damages to website operators
- **Best Practice**: Implement reasonable rate limiting

## ‚úÖ Legal Best Practices

### ü§ñ **Technical Compliance**

#### **1. Respect robots.txt**
```javascript
// Check robots.txt before scraping
const robotsUrl = `${baseUrl}/robots.txt`;
const robotsContent = await fetch(robotsUrl);
// Parse and respect directives
```

#### **2. Implement Rate Limiting**
```javascript
// Built-in rate limiting
const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
  maxConcurrent: 2,
  delayMs: 1000,
  burstLimit: 5
});
```

#### **3. Use Appropriate User Agents**
```javascript
// Identify your bot clearly
const userAgent = 'MyBot/1.0 (+https://mysite.com/bot-info)';
```

#### **4. Honor HTTP Headers**
```javascript
// Respect Retry-After and other rate limiting headers
if (response.headers['retry-after']) {
  const delay = parseInt(response.headers['retry-after']) * 1000;
  await sleep(delay);
}
```

### üìã **Documentation and Transparency**

#### **1. Maintain Scraping Logs**
```javascript
// Log all scraping activities
logger.info('Scraping started', {
  url: targetUrl,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  userAgent: userAgent,
  purpose: 'market research'
});
```

#### **2. Document Business Purpose**
- Clearly document why you're scraping
- Maintain records of data sources
- Document data retention and deletion policies

#### **3. Implement Data Governance**
```javascript
// Example data retention policy
const retentionPolicy = {
  personalData: '30 days',
  businessData: '1 year',
  anonymizedData: '5 years'
};
```

### üîí **Data Protection Compliance**

#### **1. GDPR Compliance (EU)**

**Key Requirements:**
- **Lawful Basis**: Establish legal basis for processing (legitimate interest, consent, etc.)
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
- **Accuracy**: Ensure data accuracy and keep it up to date
- **Storage Limitation**: Delete data when no longer needed
- **Right to Erasure**: Honor deletion requests

```javascript
// GDPR compliance example
const gdprCompliantScraping = {
  lawfulBasis: 'legitimate interest',
  purpose: 'market research',
  dataMinimization: true,
  retentionPeriod: '6 months',
  rightToErasure: true
};
```

#### **2. CCPA Compliance (California)**

**Key Requirements:**
- **Privacy Notice**: Inform users about data collection
- **Right to Know**: Disclose categories of personal information collected
- **Right to Delete**: Honor deletion requests
- **Right to Opt-Out**: Allow opt-out of data sale

#### **3. Data Security**
```javascript
// Implement data security measures
const securityMeasures = {
  encryption: 'AES-256',
  accessControl: 'role-based',
  auditLogging: true,
  dataAnonymization: true
};
```
